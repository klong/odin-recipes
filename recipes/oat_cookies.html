    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Soft and slightly chewy, these oaty cookies contain apple and maple syrup instead of sugar.

    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>50g butter , plus a little for greasing</li>
        <li>2 tbsp maple syrup</li>
        <li>1 dessert apple, unpeeled and coarsely grated (you need 85g)</li>
        <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>50g raisins</li>
        <li>50g porridge oats</li>
        <li>50g spelt flour</li>
        <li>40g unblanched hazelnuts , cut into chunky slices</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly grease a non-stick baking tray 
            (or line a normal baking tray with baking parchment). Tip the butter and syrup 
            into a small non-stick pan and melt together, then add the apple and cook, 
            stirring, over a medium heat until it softens, about 6-7 mins. 
            Stir in the cinnamon and raisins.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix the oats, spelt flour, and hazelnuts in a bowl, 
            pour in the apple mixture, then add the egg and beat everything together really well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon onto the baking tray, well spaced apart to make 9 mounds, then gently press into discs. 
            Bake for 18-20 mins until golden, then cool on a wire rack. 
            Will keep for 3 days in an airtight container or 6 weeks in the freezer.
